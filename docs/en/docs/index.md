Tired of rewriting the same generic CRUD routes? Need to rapidly prototype a feature for a presentation
or a hackathon? Thankfully, [fastapicrud](https://github.com/awtkns/fastapicrud) has your back. As an 
extension to the APIRouter included with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), the FastAPI CRUDRouter will automatically
generate and document your CRUD routes for you, all you have to do is pass your model and maybe your database connection.

FastAPI-CRUDRouter is also **lightning fast**, well tested, and production ready.

## Installation

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install fastapicrud

---> 100%
```

</div>



## Basic Usage
Below is a simple example of what the CRUDRouter can do. In just ten lines of code, you can generate all 
the crud routes you need for any model. A full list of the routes generated can be found [here](./routing).

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi_crudrouter import MemoryCRUDRouter as CRUDRouter

class Potato(BaseModel):
    id: int
    color: str
    mass: float

app = FastAPI()
app.include_router(CRUDRouter(schema=Potato))
```

## Advanced Usage
fastapicrud provides a number of features that allow you to get the most out of your automatically generated CRUD
routes. Listed below are some highlights.

- Automatic Pagination ([docs](https://fastapicrud.awtkns.com/pagination/))
- Ability to Provide Custom Create and Update Schemas ([docs](https://fastapicrud.awtkns.com/schemas/))
